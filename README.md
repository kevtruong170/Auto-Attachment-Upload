# Auto-Attachment-Upload

##Introduction
This script was created to solve the issue of having to take pictures, send them to an email, download them, and then store them in the corresponding folder. This script is
useful when a drive is not available and pictures must be sent through email. This script automates the process as the email will check conditions of incoming emails to 
determine whether attachments from emails should be uploaded into a folder.

##Setup
To use this script, the user must setup Outlook properly to accept macros and to run the script. Furthermore, the user should modify the functions for valid email addresses, 
and file extensions. Likewise, the folder path should be modified for correct pathing from the user's device. 

##Additional Info
The script validates email addresses, file extensions, and folder directory. If file runs into an error while saving, script will end.
